                  <p style="font-size: 20px">I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to get to finally try the FSD Beta to see what progress had been made through these years of waiting. When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood. Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow. Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me. When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though. It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is. I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second. I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.</p>

                     <p>Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I’ve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it’s 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It’s just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too. Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn’t use the turn signal all the time for me.</p><hr>
                     <p>Nope. I got the FSD Beta yesterday and it is rough. Tried to ram through a community gate at 30mph. Stopped and stalled out making an unprotected left turn. And just in general drives very very poorly in even the most basic of situations. I can see why they delayed pushing it out so long, but I am curious just how terrible the v8 and v9 FSD beta was if these are the orders of magnitude improvements we're seeing now because at this rate we'll need about 50 more of them before this thing matches regular autopilot.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sometimes I’m impressed by how it handles a straight and regular city street. Most times I am extremely mind bogglingly frustrated by how it decided to handle anything but a straight and regular street. I get that it’s beta, 100%, but this thing is not ready one bit. My recommendation to Tesla is to keep the beta group right where it’s at size-wise for 5-10 updates. With the NHTSA hot after regulation, this is not going to end well for Tesla or Tesla consumers if they keep expanding. I realized through the past few weeks of pain and torment w/ SS and now beta access that I bought the car because I like to zip around and genuinely love the tech it is really great at. I won’t be renewing my subscription come November.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">Wow. FSD is sketchy AF. lol Almost clipped a car driving thru the neighborhood. It brakes well before a stop sign and then takes 5-7 seconds deciding if it wants to keep going, or stop and wait for any incoming cars. Cause the cars behind you to surely think you’re crazy. It also just missed a whole turn. I see why Elon is nervous about going wide with this release.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">Wow the FSD beta is really something! Some things I was very impressed with. Some things remind me this is definitely Beta. Overall the drive today made me realize just how hard a problem this is. May be one of the hardest EVER! There are so many things we take for granted when driving that now must somehow get quantified in a way that a computer system can accurately react to. It seems overwhelming hard actually. BUT chipping away at it bit by bit may be the best strategy. It is such a big problem that it HAS to be broken into bite size pieces. The system has come so far from when I got my car - when it was basically just lane holding cruise control. - The visualizations are incredible. It really gives an idea what has to be tracked - and I'm sure that there is plenty not displayed! - Four way stops were handled very well. - Works decent on dirt roads. - Works good at traffic light intersections. - In heavy traffic it works as good as can be expected. Guessing what other drivers are going to do is an intuitive skill. This is where the problem is HARD. For example a human may base decisions on not only the physics (speed, acceleration etc) of another car but also what that car did at the last intersection, what kind of car it is, what condition it is in and a 100 other factors we humans just do in the background. - You have to REALLY pay attention. Just like the "classic" FSD did in the early days this Beta can make a really wrong decision. And when this system decides to do something it can go about very decisively. I had one time where it quite aggressively turned toward a curb. For the sake of the future we must be very diligent. - When turning right or left and the other traffic does not stop it can take awhile to decide when to go. This is fine for me but people behind can get impatient. - The sensor set may need to be improved before the system can handle all situations. Would be cool if there was a camera up higher or farther forward so the system could gather data without having to "creep forward" This FSD thing is really a grand project. Millions of testers, a dedicated team, and a genius visionary working toward an incredible goal. Pushing the limits of regulation too. Will it ever 100% work in every situation? Maybe? Will it be WAY better than what we had - definitely yes. It is great to go along for the ride.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">I had pretty low expectations and knew it would struggle in my urban neighborhood, but this reminds me a lot of Smart Summon. Pretty painful to use, and not sure that I’ll be showing this to anyone. I had somewhere around 15 disengagements in less than 5 miles, but it was some of the smaller things that were the most annoying. Driving down a street with traffic lights every 5-10 blocks, it would slow ~2 mph at almost every side street without a light. And turn signals! It put them on multiple times when the road just goes around a bend, or at a four way stop when going straight ahead at just a slight angle. Really confusing to other drivers who thought I was going to turn onto a different street. Takes forever at stop signs, but that’s easy enough to goose with the accelerator. One thing it did do really well and confidently was a lane change from right to left when approaching a bus stopped in the right lane.</p>
